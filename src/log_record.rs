/**
A log record.

We'd like to construct our API in a way that we don't need to allocate memory by concatenating strings, etc.

So instead our API assumes you progressively write a lot into somewhere.  However, due to the multithreaded
nature of logging, we need to be able to write to a buffer that is not shared between threads.

Instead, the design is as follows:

1.  Create a new [LogRecord].
2.  Progressively write to the [LogRecord].
3.  Finish the [LogRecord] and submit it to the [logwise::logger::Logger].

/*
Boilerplate notes
# LogRecord

I think Clone probably makes sense although I'm not sure how much use it would get necessarily.
PartialEq and Eq make sense
Ord makes no sense
Hash
Default
Display is probably sensible; we can display the log record.
From/Into - not very sensible
AsRef/AsMut - not necessarily a great implementation.
Defef - must deref to a pointer type, which we don't necessarily have
Send - yes, Sync - no
