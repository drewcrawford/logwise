/**
A log record.

We'd like to construct our API in a way that we don't need to allocate memory by concatenating strings, etc.

So instead our API assumes you progressively write a lot into somewhere.  However, due to the multithreaded
nature of logging, we need to be able to write to a buffer that is not shared between threads.

Instead, the design is as follows:

1.  Create a new [LogRecord].
2.  Progressively write to the [LogRecord].
3.  Finish the [LogRecord] and submit it to the [logwise::logger::Logger].

/*
Boilerplate notes for LogRecord:

IMPLEMENTED:
- Debug: Derived - essential for diagnostics
- Clone: Derived - useful for record duplication/forwarding  
- PartialEq/Eq: Derived - enables record comparison and deduplication
- Hash: Derived - consistent with Eq, enables use in hash collections
- Default: Implemented - provides sensible zero-value (Info level, empty parts)
- Display: Implemented - formats record parts for output

NOT IMPLEMENTED:
- Copy: Vec<String> contains heap-allocated data, not suitable for Copy
- Ord/PartialOrd: No meaningful ordering for log records
- From/Into: No obvious conversions to/from other types
- AsRef/AsMut: No clear underlying type to reference
- Deref: Must deref to a pointer type, which LogRecord doesn't naturally provide

AUTOMATIC:
- Send: Automatically implemented - Vec<String> and Level are Send
- Sync: NOT automatically implemented - Vec<String> is not Sync (but records
  are typically owned by single threads during construction anyway)
